## General info
The project populates the details of the 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons (DnD) API spellings in an interactive table. The UI lets you navigate each spell to know more information provided with index by DnD API `api/spells/{index}`. The app allows the users to add any spell he likes to his favourites. User can filter his favourites. All the reducers and actions are tests using Jest testing framework(we used react-redux to manage states). We used Tailwind CSS, react js, react-router-dom, react-redux, and typescript.
